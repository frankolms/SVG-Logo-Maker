# SVG-Logo-Maker

This is a fully functioning inquirer command line application that takes four different prompts from the user. Enter a color, enter up to three characters, enter a color for text, and choose a shape between circle, square, and triangle. An SVG file will be generated that takes the answers from all of those prompts and creates that SVG.
